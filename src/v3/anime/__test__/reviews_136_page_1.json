      "content": "Hunter X Hunter is a Shonen adventure series, yes, but there´s actually a lot that differs from your typical shonen-show. In a good way. I´ll explain why gradually through the review, let´s begin.\r\n\r\nStory\r\nThe story is good, but not really anything mind breaking. It´s about Gon, a 12 year old boy, trying to become a hunter so he can find his father who left him as a child. A hunter is basically a person with a hunters license, and the concept of hunting can be almost anything. As long as you complete the difficult and deadly Hunters exam and get your license you can do whateveryou want with it, so naturally there´s all kinds hunters, everything from hunters who hunt criminals, hunters who ARE criminals and hunters who tries to master the art of cooking, for example.  \\n\r\n\\n\r\nSo in the first part of the series it´s about the exam and you follow Gon and his 3 companions as they try to survive the exam. What you´re going to notice is that the story involves very little fighting, and yet it´s really intense. In the third exam for example they have to fight against dangerous criminals, but instead of beating up all of them with super-lightning attacks they introduce different kinds of simple methods, like janken, and make it really interesting. This is executed very nicely and feels refreshing if you´ve watched other Shonen-series.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe show does not end after the exam though, it continues with the celestial tower arc and the yorkshin auction arc, and especially the latter is extremely entertaining. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nYes, it is quite old and some people might not like it. Personally I didn´t mind though, both art and animation were smooth, and even if you don´t like older art you´ll probably find it acceptable. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe openings and endings were nothing special, but I personally loved the BGM! The songs really fit well in the athmosphere and I actually came back to some parts just because the music was so good and fit the whole show so perfectly. The voice acting was also really good, and I didn´t really notice anything to complain about. Voices fit characters really well (I watched the subs).\\n\r\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nHere is when the series really start to shine! The characters are great, and unlike too many other shonen shows they are actually both memorable and they don´t feel forced in any way, this without 12 episodes from their pasts. They also get developed a lot in the show and you find youself just enjoying to watch the characters together. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nEven if the first 7 or so episodes are a bit slow, once you get into this show it´s never boring. It´s not slow paced and there´s always something new and interesting happening in every episode (there might be some exceptions, but I can´t think of any just like that). It´s actually one of the most enjoyable series I have ever seen. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nOn of the best shows out there, watch it now! Even if you normally dont like shonen shows, this might still entertain you! It´s not slow paced, there´s more focus on plot than fighting and it actually ends (even if the ending is very open). I recommend this to everyone and especially if you like other shonen shows, then you will love this one, it is the best typical shonen adventure anime out there.",

      "content": "First off, for the sake of simplicity I'm going to cover all four series (one TV series and three OVAs) in one review, since they actually form a single continuous story. \r\n\r\nGenerally I approach shounen titles with care, since many of them strike me as a bit shallow and vacuous. Hunter X Hunter, however, sounded quite interesting. On the strength of one solitary review, I gave it a watch.\r\n\r\nI'll begin with a brief summary: Hunter X Hunter revolves around a ten-ish year old boy named Gon who discovers that his permanently absentee father, Ging, is, in fact, one of the most famous and respected Huntersin the world. Hunters hunt various things, from criminals to recipe ingredients, depending on their individual talents and preferences. It seems to Gon that the only way he is going to have access to the resources to find and finally meet his father is to become a Hunter himself - so he cheerfully sets off to take the Hunter Exam. The four Hunter X Hunter series document Gon's attempts to become a Hunter and find Ging, punctuated by various distractions that result from the myriad troubles of the friends he makes along the way.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nAfter two or three episodes, it seemed pleasant enough but uninspiring. By episode seven or so, when the Hunter Exam starts in earnest, it begins to become more interesting. Before long, I was completely absorbed. Unlike many shounen series I've glimpsed, Hunter X Hunter doesn't rely too much on fighting (except for the Celestial Tower arc - the weakest of the lot, but necessary to everything that follows it) and actually has engaging characters who I ended up sincerely caring about. That's a rarity for me in any form of TV/film, but particularly in anime, and very particularly in shounen. In this case, I actually almost wept a single sorrowful tear when the final episode of the final OVA ended, so attached had I become to the central group of characters.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nOne of the great things about Gon as a 'hero' in a shounen title is he isn't the most powerful character, nor does he want to be. He wants to be good enough to qualify as a Hunter and find his father, but that's all - and he often fails to triumph in difficult situations, whether in combat or a battle of wits or a game. He is surrounded by stronger, faster, cleverer characters; in particular, the mysterious and repellent Hisoka is leagues ahead of anyone else in the series in sheer power and skill.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nAgain, though, combat is not as prominent as one might expect in Hunter X Hunter. It does occur, but it slots smoothly and naturally into the flow of events rather than feeling crowbarred in, as is so often the case in anime of this type.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest points of the whole thing is the interaction between the core characters. It's hugely enjoyable simply watching them together, seeing their friendships develop, shift emphasis, come apart, and take on new dimensions. And every single one of the characters has more depth than I thought was possible in shounen.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nNow to the negatives. They are few, but worth mentioning.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe first thing to mention is this series does take some time to get going. The first half a dozen episodes meander along quite sedately as though they're little more than a travelogue. After that, everything is fine up until the Second Test of the Hunter Exam, which really irritated me. I'm not going to say why, since I want to avoid spoilers, but quite how none of the characters stabbed anyone in a fit of rage is a mystery.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe first major low point, though, arrives during the second arc, when some of the characters undertake a stupidly DBZ-like weight-training regime. I nearly took my head in my hands in despair. Fortunately, it was over fairly quickly.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe most sustained of the poorer points of the series is the aforementioned Celestial Tower arc. Fighting tournaments do little for me unless I'm participating (I mean Mortal Kombat etc, not actual, real fighting. Good grief, what do you take me for?). The major developments of this arc are pivotal to later events, but it was still a bit of a chore to sit through the duels - except the all-too-brief outings for Killua, who is always entertaing to watch in confrontations.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that unsettled me about Hunter X Hunter as I went along was the change in tech. The first plot arc is all sailing ships, bows and occasional scraps of near-ruined modern technology (with the notable exception of a motorbike in Gon's photo of Ging), but each arc increases the tech level until, by the time we reach the York Shin arc, cars, automatic weapons and the internet are commonplace. This is somewhat jarring at first, but the more time is spent in York Shin, the less noticable it becomes.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nOne more thing I'd like to mention is the music. The reviews I've read of the several Hunter X Hunter series all claim that the music improves as the series progress. While I concede that some of the music in G.I. Final is good, I actually preferred the early music. In particular, I rapidly grew to pine for the melody I think of as 'Gon's Theme', which is rarely heard outside the first story arc.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nI'll end my poorly-structured rambling there (listening to this month's Terrorizer cover CD isn't conducive to coherent writing) with a high recommendation. Hunter X Hunter is among my top three anime. Fans of harem anime or fan service may want to avoid; fans of good character, interesting plot and colourful action with the odd touch of the strange and sinister should watch at the next opportune moment.",

      "content": "No matter the version, HxH is my favorite shounen series of all time. This adaptation is my favorite despite lacking the new story arcs (:\r\n\r\nHxH is categorized as a shounen in the database, but you better not start thinking about the latest episode Naruto n friends. This is far beyond any generic shounen trash. I've heard people describe it a disguised seinen, not gonna take cred for thinking of that but I totally agree. HxH doesn't constantly bullshit you, it's too real.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the story might look extremely generic; boy trying to find his father yada yada, but don't judge the book by itscover, you'd be doing yourself a disservice doing so in this case. It features some of the best storytelling that has ever come out of the medium, clearly much thought was put into it. It's a story I can happily wait 2-3 years between volumes to read, because I know it'll never disappoint.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nSo it might be looked at as as seinen disguised as a shounen, which you can tell by how little fighting there is. The fights in are sparse and short, but extremely memorable because of how they're built up and executed. The show builds up for some of these fights for several episodes, and the payoff is always so satisfying despite sometimes being short. Even when they seem the most pointless, you'll grow to appreciate them.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe characters are hella good too; Kurapika, Leorio, Gon, Killua, Hisoka, Chrollo and even the smallest of characters have strong presences. They each have their own unique motive and also their own hurdles to tackle.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe characters is a point where I think the 2011 version is lacking comparatively. The first arc of the show is double the length in the original series, and they take that time to make you feel more connected with the characters. You get to see them interact more with each other in ways not shown in the 2011 version. You also get to see key plot points which were neglected in the remake in favor of speeding it up to the more actiony parts.  It's the biggest reason why I think people who only watched the 2011 adaptation should consider watching it, at least the first arc anyhow.\\n\r\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\n\\n\r\nNow you might say something in the likes of: \"Eww old art, unwatchable\". If you don't like old anime, that's fine. HxH's art can definitely be off-putting to some, the color scheme tends to be very dark, and the animation is really wonky at times. But for the rest, you can enjoy one of the most atmospheric anime shows ever, in terms of both story and visuals.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, the actual characters are poorly drawn at times, especially in the first arc, but the show gets more consistently good art and animation as it progresses. Toward the end, I think the art is very well done and nice-looking. I much prefer the character designs of the 1999 version, they don't look so over-the-top as they do in the 2011 adaptation.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself one of the reasons for my 8/10 score. It pales in comparison to shows like Rurouni Kenshin and YuYu Hakusho which aired years before Hunter. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is awesome. It fits perfectly with the show's atmosphere. It truly is one of those soundtracks I can listen to all the way through without skipping. \\n\r\nI even went back to certain parts where nothing remarkable was happening, but the visuals and presentation made it awesome.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nHxH has some of my favorite intros and outros, especially the second and third intros. The second in particular I consider to be a masterpiece, as it conveys what the main character of the arc goes through perfectly, and with such a distinct and neat style. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are funky sometimes, like when Hisoka strangles Gon a balloon scratch effect plays, and you can totally tell it's just a guy scratching a balloon :_:\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound effects don't distract from the enjoyment for me, it's still a definite 10/10. There's hardly ever a dull moment in this show, especially when you take the time to invest yourself in the story.\\n\r\n\\n\r\n--\\n\r\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Good story with solid characters, dope ass soundtrack and awesome settings with a dark and gritty atmosphere. \\n\r\nThere are considerable differences between the adaptations, so you should watch both this, the OVAs and the remake. The OVAs continue the story where he 1999 series left off.",

      "content": "Hunter x Hunter is your typical Shounen, Action, Adventure anime with the usual plot-devices but with a pretty unique concept of &ldquo;hunting&rdquo;. This series may not adrenaline filled action sequences but it is still highly enjoyable, with plenty of tension.\r\n\r\nHxH start of about skilled individuals trying to become professional hunters for their own individual reasons. The story follows a young boy (Gon Freaks) on his quest to become hunter, in order to find his hunter dad. The beginning is just about candidates undergoing treacherous tasks and challenges, whilst forming bonds during the long hunter exam. Some, including me, may be bored by the lackluster beginningbut sometime into the hunter exam arc the series picks up and become very interesting and captivating to watch. The following arcs manage to up the level, bringing so much to the unique story but it&rsquo;s a shame that it never finishes within the TV series.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe characters of HxH are the usual batch of protagonist and antagonist found in shounen anime and each of them manages to fit the bill. They all are interesting and unique in their own way. They develop so much throughout the show, even though most of the time it revolves around Gon. Gon himself is what you&rsquo;d call a typical protagonist and even though his ideals are somewhat annoying, he can do astonishing things that will surprise anyone. Not to mention the other main characters: Killua, Kurapika and Leorio who all manage to bring something astounding to the show.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that may come to your mind with the animation, is how dated it looks however when you put that aside you can easily take the animation for its merits. The art style is great and there are plenty of fluid fights but they can be a little fast paced. The music is pretty good, as it can help build up the tension and can just as easily release the tension with some upbeat tunes. Nonetheless the music itself feels more dated than the animation.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nOverall HxH is a very entertaining Shounen, Action, Adventure but with an intricate plot and concept, which develops as the story goes on. There&rsquo;s plenty of stupid comedy to enjoy, plus a lot of major developments and intense combat. The series may not focus entirely on fighting but the methods of fighting actually evolves later on in the series, into something more diverse and complex (Nen). It&rsquo;s a shame that the TV series doesn&rsquo;t resolve anything and the OVAs don&rsquo;t provide much resolution either. Other than that this is definitely a shounen anime series worth watching, if you're in this kind of thing.\\n\r\n\\n\r\n^_^",

      "content": "The basic premise of the story is Gon, a young boy living on Whale Island, one day meets an apprentice of his father. This hunter tells him about his long lost father, Ging, and awakens in Gon the desire to become a hunter in order to find his father. Along the way to the Professional Hunter Exams, Gon meets and befriends Killua (from an assassin family), Kurapica (last survivor of a tribe murdered by the Ryodan) and Leorio (who wants to be a doctor).\r\n\r\nAt 62 episodes long, one might think what on earth could be so interesting about people who hunt things. Well, this isone of the best storylines ever! It starts slow, but as soon as they got into the hunter exam the pace picked up  (literally) and the viewer becomes engrossed.  There is also a good background philosophy on the fighting styles and abilities of Nen users.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nI can\\'t stress enough how good the plot twists are, the character development is perfect and the story is so well fleshed out that there is potential for a spin off with any of the main and half the side characters, Killua and Hisoka especially. Now that is depth! Hisoka himself is one of the best anime villians ever written. Bravo to the writer for creating this world and characters.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe art was nothing fantastic, it\\'s very bright and cheerful which fits in with the main protagonist\\'s age of 12. It serves its purpose but won\\'t make you go \\&quot;aaaah, this could be a picture\\&quot;. Action scenes are very well done.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this whole series and it left me wanting more. By the end of the series I was mumbling to myself that 62 episodes just weren\\'t enough even though Hunter x Hunter arc was \\&quot;finished\\&quot;. Luckily there are 3 other OVAs after that to deal with the offshoot unanswered questions.",

Of course this is not it, all the animals are ugly! lol\r\rHunter X Hunter is one of the best shonen animes I have ever seen.  For those who like to watch bleach will enjoy this anime.  The only thing I have against it is that it has ended so soon T__T\r\rThe story has enough fighting scenes which are very cleverly thought out, and does not drag on for too long but leaves you completely satisfied with the result.  No fillers which istotally great!\\n\r\\n\rThe animation is good; the original TV series are not as greater quality than the OVA because it is older.\\n\r\\n\rYou don't really notice the sounds as much which is good, that means it totally blends in with the scenes.  The openings and endings songs aren't that great, I only like the first opening song Ohayo.  The voices of the characters really make the anime alive.  The voice actor of Gon did the voice actor of Naruto as well.  I really like Hisoka's voice, the voice actor is very talented, it really suits the creepy character (he also did Harima Kenji from school rumble).\\n\r\\n\rThe characters are very well thought out which and they are very funny in their own ways.  The background of the main characters are interesting.

      "content": "Overall: \r\rMy very best anime and i haven't actually seen anything else to the same level. Hunter x Hunter is personally a masterpiece that the community has greatly forgotten and as much as i think that's unfortunate i am just glad that i had the chance to watch this anime. Basically i love it because of these two  rounded factors: story-wise and unique characters.\r\rAnimation: \r\rNot the best actually but the art did progress  little by little  in each episode. The beginning felt really old and looked something that lack much colors. It was after  if i believe  the first arcthat the art was changed and if i were to grade that quality aside of the awful beginning i would say that it does deserve a 10.  \\n\rHunter x Hunter's world approached a lot realistically to our world  if we were to put aside all the magical power stuff and that's one of the good trait that i like about this anime. \\n\rThe character designs were as much as great too and quite unique. Their clothes were fashionable and not something i have seen yet in other anime.\\n\r\\n\rSound: \\n\r\\n\rAs much as everyone else  seem to love the first opening song of this anime i do however find it horrible and that unfortunately brings it to this score. That aside i love the other opening and ending songs and they are as now as my main favorites. One specific character's voice i really like was Hisoka, he sounded kind a creepy perverted and fitted perfectly his character. The others too sounded great but i took more an account of hisoka because it was quite amazing.\\n\r\\n\rStory: \\n\r\\n\rOverall hunter x hunter has the best story and i find it much addictive than anything else i have watched so far. The story gets complicated in each episode and i love that unpredictiveness that they bring in every part. \\n\r\\n\rGon as the main character decides one day to go on a journey to find his dad which he is a hunter and the only way for Gon to achieve this course it's to become a hunter himself. Being an hunter ins't just an easy task and nothing as to say as prosperous ever really come off of this job. The story on this specific note round along 4 characters and they all have to become Hunters for their own goals. Kurapika who he is the last survivor of his tribe and now he is seeking revenge, Leorio who is attempting to become a doctor after the sad death of his friend, Killua who is a born assassin but now he wants to choose another path and Gon who basically wants to find his father. Needless to say as Good characters come evil always follow and they aren't as easy to read as any other villain that may be predicted in other anime. Their role ins't to say to be just the \"antagonist\" and they appear as much alive and important as any other character in the story. \\n\rOverall this is the basic view of how the story is developed into.\\n\r\\n",

      "content": "Note: This review will encompass the main series and the OVAs since they all flow together. There might be some minor spoilers, depending on what you consider a spoiler.\r\n\r\nMost shounen fighting anime are generic and clichéd. They follow the same format in nearly every aspect, using trite ideas that have worked before to gain a large, marketable fan base. As a result, you get a shit load of characters with massive, destructive powers and crazy designs.  It’s no surprise really, as these shows are geared towards young teens after all, most of whom don’t necessarily care about unique storylines or concepts as long asthere is a lot of action to satiate their naturally aggressive demeanors.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Hunter x Hunter seems to be just another one of those. It uses ideas we’ve all seen before: strong-willed protagonists, last survivors of a race/clan, “ki” energy (called Nen), training to become stronger, tournament arcs, etc. Make no mistake though. For every tired concept it applies, the show has a way of twisting them.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple. Gon Freecss, a young boy who had always believed his father was dead, finds out that his dad is in fact one of the greatest Hunters in the world. (Hunters are a strong group of people that perform various tasks, be it finding coveted pieces of work, eliminating dangerous criminals, etc.) He sets out to find his father, but first, he must enter the Hunter exam to become a hunter. Along the way, he befriends many people and is caught up with various other situations. The pacing is rather slow in the beginning, admittedly, but patience is rewarded, and you will be quickly addicted once the real action begins.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters may seem to follow typical shounen conventions, but don’t mistaken them for your average shounen archetype. For example, while Gon is a determined protagonist with incredible potential, he is often outmatched by clearly superior opponents. In fact, he is portrayed as one of the weaker characters for much of the series.  His best friend, Killua Zoldyck, is a cold-blooded assassin who initially seems invincible, but in spite of this, he really is just a fun-loving kid trying to abandon his ruthless methods. Also, as the series progresses, we realize he is far from invincible, and he mentally breaks down when facing stronger enemies. There are many other interesting characters as well, such as Kurapika, an outwardly rational person who really is seeking revenge against the mysterious Genei Ryodan organization after they wiped out his clan, as well as Hisoka, Leorio, etc.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the aspect that Hunter x Hunter excels best is in its depiction of the relationships between characters. The pairing of ostensibly polar personalities in Gon and Killua is fun to watch, and we see both of them flourish under the encouragement of one another. Then there’s Hisoka, the creepy, possibly pedophilic clown guy who’s also one of the strongest characters in the anime. He’s a sadist whose only goal is to fight and kill powerful opponents, so he essentially protects his budding seeds (Gon and Killua) until they are ripe for consumption. Anyone who interferes with their developments will likely be killed. The relationships between the various members of the Genei Ryodan are unconventional for your average evil organization. Unlike in other series, in which other members usually mock their fellow colleagues when they’re defeated, some of these guys legitimately care about other members and their well-beings. This is ironic given the nature of the group, a fact later pointed out by Gon.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe fighting and ki abilities, called Nen, in this series definitely diverge from the norm. First of all, major battles aren’t as plentiful as in other shounens. Sure, there is some fighting in each episode, but you’re not gonna see a hundred different fights here. Although the plot isn’t mind-bogglingly complex, this shounen is much more plot-driven rather than just being based all around fighting. As for Nen, this is easily one of the most intricate systems of energy I’ve seen. Basically, all Nen users fall into six different categories: transformation, reinforcement, manipulation, materialization, emission, and specialization. Their hatsu, or unique technique, is centered on one of these groups, and while people can use abilities from other groups, they aren’t nearly as strong as their abilities from their own group. I do have a gripe with the specialization group though, given its “break all rules of Nen” possibilities. Furthermore, there are many basic techniques that Nen users must master, such as hiding their aura, seeing others’ auras, and controlling the distribution of Nen throughout the body in order to defend from attacks and deal stronger blows. While overall power certainly is a major factor to the outcome of fights, this system provides for a much more strategic way of fighting. You don’t necessarily have to be the stronger person to win a fight. Also, you definitely won’t see any random ass pull power ups at critical points of fights.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is somewhat dated, but it’s understandable since it was made a decade ago. In fact, it’s arguably more preferable, as it gives the show a darker feel to it. By the second OVA though, the animation quality improves dramatically, and designs are slicker, brighter, and more colorful. The music is decent, nothing groundbreaking. It helps enhance the drama of many scenes like it’s supposed to. I especially like the second OP of the main series, which gives an apt atmosphere to that portion of the show.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the anime ends before the manga does at somewhat of a cliffhanger. I would argue that this is probably more preferable than a continuation of the manga because the story diverts from the main plot into its longest arc yet, one that is not very good. Nonetheless, it leaves many unresolved questions unfortunately, but it’s still a great ending. The mangaka also created Yu Yu Hakusho, and you can definitely see similarities, especially in some of the characters’ personalities, but in my opinion, Hunter x Hunter is superior in every facet, including characterization. Shounens aren’t meant to be taken too seriously, but this is one of the few that has substance rather than just the appeal of violence. The genre is stale for the most part, but Hunter x Hunter is one of its few gems. Definitely one of the best.\\n",

      "content": "The lack of fandom surrounding Hunter X Hunter is somewhat enigmatic to me. It is a title that, by all rights, should have a huge buzz behind it. Not only is Hunter X Hunter the work of Yoshihiro Togashi, the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho, but it is also far superior to other currently running big-hype titles, the most prominent of which is Naruto. It manages to be enormously entertaining through its unique concoction of animation, characterization, and plot, without resorting to the cliches that have all too often ruined a seemingly novel show of a similar vein. And yet Hunter X Hunter remains littleknown. With any luck this review will have a hand in lifting the veil of obscurity that currently surrounds this magnificent title.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, the story of Hunter X Hunter is vibrant and imaginative, though not at all difficult. Right from the start the aim of this series is made clear, the eventual reunion of Gon with his father. However, the path that is taken to achieve this end is full of twists and turns that continuously succeed in keeping this tale fresh. The viewer is ceaselessly wisked between offbeat situations as varied as the dangerous wilderness to a battle-stage tower with over two hundred floors of increasingly difficult fighting tournaments. It is through these atypical situations that we come to understand the motivations of our lead and become endeared to his cause. A superb level of attention in plotting is also dedicated to the other prominent cast members, including Gon's companions Killua, Leorio, and Kurapica. Though the centerpiece here is Gon, none of the supporting roles go underdeveloped. In fact the only problem with plotting is that the story takes a few episodes to really get churning. If you can make it to about episode six or seven though, you will be fully strapped in for one hell of a fun ride.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nA rather unexpected facet of this title is how lightly the plot focuses on fighting, especially given that Togashi’s most famous work, Yu Yu Hakusho, was often little more than a continuous battle-fest. To be certain, fighting does take place and at some points in the series it becomes quite prominent, but it never manages to wrestle the spotlight away from the fleshier portions of the narrative. Despite this, the action leaves very little to be desired. The fight-action sets here are more complex than the typical ki-blasting, as fast-as-light-movement farce that has become the industry standard for fighting anime. Instead we are treated to a truly creative power-leveling system and a diversity of combat styles that make each fight more than simply diversionary but instead truly engaging. It is as if the battle scenes have actually added to the tension and excitement of the plotline rather than flattened it, a rare occurrence indeed.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nLeaving just a bit more to be desired of Hunter X Hunter, however, are the peripherals. Musically, while not bad, HXH just does not manage to live up to its more palatial qualities. Still, the music is good enough and has continuously improved throughout the series. I have personally enjoyed the opening and closing music more and more with each successive theme change that occurs. Additionally the animation is mostly quite nice. It certainly isn’t spectacular by any stretch of the imagination, but it is visually appealing. There is also a definite change for the better in terms of animation the further one progresses through the show. The set pieces have strong appeal as well, and are reasonably effective at immersing us in this strange and phenomenal world.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe most remarkable aspect of Hunter X Hunter, however, lies within its remarkable characters. Most of the cast here is not at all generic or formulaic, a welcome retreat from the chiefly derivative characters so prominent in similar shows. Gon, the show’s lead, is a charismatic young boy whose optimism and innocence is always invigorating without being imposing. An odd tidbit, Gon is virtually never the strongest character on the screen, by a long shot. A partial reason for this is that his goal isn’t necessarily to be the strongest being in existence but primarily to better himself. This is another big plus in the personality department that sets Gon apart from your conventional “Shonen Jump Hero Archtype”. Gon’s optimism is offset well by the darker, more brooding persona of Killua, a young boy that Gon befriends early in the show. Together they make for perhaps the most interesting pair of best friends in all of anime. Their companions, Leorio and Kurapica, also make for complex and interesting characters. Leorio is a man who, haunted by his past, is motivated to the performance of benevolent acts to the benefit of humanity. Kurapica, conversely, is motivated by revenge, though revenge is an ideal that is out of character for him. Consequently, Kurapica always seems to be a man at odds with himself. Equally compelling are the more contemptible figures of this tale such as Hisoka, Kuroro, and the rest of the Genei Ryodan. The interplay of these vastly different personalities is the bread and butter of Hunter X Hunter.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nIt should be no secret that Hunter X Hunter has bewitched me. Beyond some very minor failings, it is nearly beyond fault. It carries with it a sort of energy and charm that is very intoxicating. To put it most concisely, Hunter X Hunter should be considered Yoshihiro Togashi’s new masterwork. Any less firm a designation would be an injustice against this superb animated opus.\\n\r\n\\n",

      "content": "First, I will state watched this series at least 3 times. You may be thinking I'm quite biased, especially giving it a 10. But that's how I really feel since this Anime always manages to excite me yet give me a wide range of emotions. Mostly excite though ( I find it to be an adrenaline pumping Anime )\r\n\r\n. Pros\r\n+ Main characters are well developed and loveable\r\n+ Villains also have depth and are very interesting too\r\n+ Minor characters themselves are unique too\r\n+ No fillers\r\n+ Plenty of comedy to keep it balanced\r\n+ Plenty of action , great battles\r\n+ Never a dull moment\r\n+ Outdated visuals ( itgives it a gritty feel and adds to the experience )\\n\r\n+ Mature theme\\n\r\n+ People actually die\\n\r\n+ Music fits perfectly\\n\r\n+ Good pacing\\n\r\n\\n\r\n. Cons\\n\r\n- The main plot can be described in one sentence. Gon wants to finds his dad\\n\r\n- Outdated visuals\\n\r\n- No romance ( you're looking at the wrong place )\\n\r\n\\n\r\n. In Detail :\\n\r\nI could go on and on about how great this Anime is but I'll try to keep it short. First, the story. Gon wants to find his father. That's it. While the plot is simple, his journey to finding his father is what makes this Anime so great. I mean, look at One Piece, Luffy just wants to obtain One Piece ( and Naruto wants to become Hokage ), but it's the adventure that counts. I would recommend at least watching 20 episodes ( 10 minimum ) before giving up on the series. While the visuals and quality is dated, I feel this is what gives the Anime an even grittier and mature feel. Unlike Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, not many people die and when sometimes they do they come back to life, here in HxH, they stay dead. This made a difference to me, since I could feel that the characters were in much greater danger and I could take the Anime more seriously. The best thing about the Anime is the characters. You get to know them, understand them, and watch them grow and mature throughout the series. None of the episodes seem to drag on and so you can't help but watch the next episode to find out what happens next. The fights and situations the main characters are put in definitely make this series worth watching. After the TV series the OVAs get pretty interesting to watch too.  I highly recommend this Anime to anyone, especially to those who like Bleach, Naruto, or One Piece, this is a better alternative.",

The anime illustrated some important lessons in life, such as friendship, determination and teamwork, through scenarios that might actually happen in reallife. The Opening theme is awesome, and so is the closing and the inserts. Definately a must watch.",

      "content": "As a fan of HxH 2011 I thought to myself it would be fun to watch the first anime  adaption and compare the two of them, this review will therefore refer to the 2011 adaption from time to time. This is also why this is supposed to mostly aim for those who have already watched HxH-11. This review will be reviewing the anime series and its 3 ovas which makes it 92 episodes long instead of 62.\r\n\r\nHxH is special in a lot of ways and one of those is its storyline. The story follows Gon in his travels to find his father and inhis search get around to many places. There are clear distinctions between acts and in these it constantly walks a fine line between being light hearted and being deadly serious. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe art was fine most the time and it actually delighted me, as it is clear that it is not only the darker colors that adds to a more serious adaption than the 2011 adaptation, but also the story in general. The anime has a more violent tone than its 2011 adaption, while I do like this, it means that the humor is less apparent. Not to say it is not there, but it is toned down a little. To me this is the most clear difference between the two animes. A kid friendly adaption and a version I belief (without actually knowing) is more alike to its original material.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nNow for a enormous disappointment. \\n\r\nThe score of 4 is apparently \"decent\", well it was better than decent most of the time but when the animation have many dark colors in it there must be some measures to make sure that whatever scene that have a dark setting, such as an enclosed room with very little light, should be able to contain the feeling of an enclosed room while the viewer also should be able to see what is going on! But no obviously not. I do understand this is anime is up in the age where it can be called old, but this was simply to awful. More than once did I have to concentrate and sometimes refer to my memory of HxH-11 to know what was going on. There are two things which makes this setpack okay. 1: I like the show so I still watched it and to be honest it did not happen that often, but often enough so it was irritating as hell. 2: The problem was no where to be seen with the second ova \"Greed Island\".\\n\r\n\\n\r\nHxH shines the most when it comes to its characters. HxH allow itself to show both the negative and the positive side of many of the characters, good guys and the bad alike. Their personalities is fleshed out as this is highlighted by the condition of their superpowers, Nen. Not to go into details, but ones personality reflects what sort of Nen-power a person have. It only helps to understand the characters which I love this show for doing. I have also thought of the seven death sins as I watched this shows, not that I usually do that when watching an anime, so I do not how many of them be found in other shows, but they sure can in HxH. Most notably in Hisoka(Luxuria/lust) and Kurapika(Ira/anger). \\n\r\n\\n\r\nNow for quick comparison between the two adaptations:\\n\r\n- The amount of manga released differs greatly from 1999 to 2011 (duuhh of course.) This made the HxH-99 storyline more detailed\\n\r\n- Overall a darker atmosphere in HxH-99\\n\r\n- Darker art used, both literally but also in the things shown --> adds to the atmosphere in the story\\n\r\n      -   An example of this is when a heart is shown versus the exact same scene in HxH-11 where the heart is in a bag but beats to show that it is indeed a heart\\n\r\n- A little to dark art used a times in HxH-99\\n\r\n\\n\r\nWhile the art was a letdown, it could not take away the joy of the experience of HxH. Had the two versions been to similar it would have been boring, but it was not.\\n\r\n\\n\r\n\\n",

      "content": "I'm not a big shonen follower. I dislike long anime. Yet Hunter x Hunter, from the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho, managed to sneak its way into my top 5 anime of all time. \r\n\r\nImagine a shonen series where the main character, a young boy, does NOT start out as a complete idiot who knows nothing trying to be the best trainer/ ninja/ fighter in the whole wide world. Our hero, Gon, from the first episode is already skilled, patient and persistant. He is young, boyish and naive but never annoyingly so. And his aim, reflecting his character, is pure and simple; he wants tomeet his father, who he's never met.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nRather than beginning with long boring training scenes, Hunter x Hunter gets straight to the point and starts with the action filled Hunter's Exam. Well, it does take a few episodes to really get there, but as other reviewers have suggested, please give this series a chance through the first few, at least five episodes. Yes, the artwork is a bit dated and it's a bit cheesy and Gon makes animal friends. Skip the first few eps if you must. The real treat is coming.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe Hunter exam is not like anything you've ever taken at school before. And it certainly doesn't rely overmuch on simple muscle or physical strength. So you're not going to see boys beating each other up, moving on to the next bad guy, lather rinse repeat, oh no.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe Hunter Exam is about testing it's contestants, psychologically and physically. It forces them to form friendships to complete certain tasks, then pits everyone against each other, about giving choices where each choice is more deadly than the last and choosing not to choose is a gamble. Some episodes have a lot, and I mean a lot of clever dialogue and talking, while others are more action based. It's overall quite a smart series, and rather dark; people die (and stay dead) and good doesn't always triumph. In fact, some of the most morally ambiguous people and situations you may ever encounter take place in this series.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nOne of Hunter x Hunter's strong points is it's cast of characters. Not only do our main 4 boys have strong, three-dimensional personalities but so does every other character on the show, from old family friends who appear for a few episodes or recurring characters that appear ever so often.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nWe have Killua, the fan favorite, a white haired, sometimes angsty teenaged boy who is actually an assassin from a big, famed, filthy rich family of assassins. (Just wait till you meet his family). Killua is blunt and sarcastic, basically Gon's foil.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nKurapica, my favorite character, is another story. Aloof, proud, collected, highly intelligent and harboring plenty of dark secrets, Kurapica is the brains of the operation, getting them out of plenty of tight spots where muscle just doesn't cut it. But as you soon find out, it's not that he lacks muscle or fighting skill. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have...Leorio. At first glance you may wonder why he's really even there. He spends most of the series lagging a bit behind his younger friends.He's really just an average guy and provides a lot of the series humor. Though some people consider him to be an extra addition that doesn't make sense, I think the series just wouldn't be the same without him. Somewhere in the midst of all the insanity this average guy barely keeping up with them just works. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nReally it's the characters that pull this series together, from the ever talkative ninja, to the Hunter Examiner without a mouth (who nevertheless talks a plenty), to the evil Hisoka who delights in finding those challenging enough to kill to the deranged family of assassins. Everywhere you turn is a new, interesting character, some of them more unique and original than many main characters in other series.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nSo overall, if you're looking for a solid anime that isn't regularly interrupted by filler, features great battles, great characters, dark, gritty artwork and smooth animation then Hunter x Hunter is for you.",

Everyone wants to there fighting spirit to manifest into cool powers, HxH does this very well.\r\nThe concept of being a hunter in this series is also really cool. basically people who are so masterful that they aren't held back by the nuances of society, obtaining wealth is rated G for really easy in terms of being a hunter. \r\ndispite the great character design, i'm not truly a fan of Gon,Kurapika, or Anthonio or w/e. I appreciate the allegory involved in these characters, i'm just not a huge fan of their motivations. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nwhat I truly love about this adaption is the OST and Visuals. take me back 25 years please so i can get the animation and audio quality from this time period back! I recall the warm summer sky of the pre-greed island arc with the amazing pan flute track. reminds me of golden sun on the GBA.",

      "content": "Hunter x Hunter, I' watched the show once in a former television channel, since at first glance the series did not seem flashy, but continued talking of my friends about the series I did buy it in format disc that had Fortune had a store discs needed.\r\n\r\nThe story was interestin' from the point of view of Gon who is a boy with Flat characteristics being a child raised in the middle of the jungle with the ability to perceive and hear things that ordinary people are not used, the 90's version is be somewhat slightly higher than its modern counterpart, and I don't mean tohave more sympathy to this than the modern version, the design of the characters, setting and theme music were better. Compared to now the 2011 anime has a simple design and trying to get all the fast sections, in the 1999 version feal features more defined, dark environments you implied that everything was not all pink, where you really felt fear of Hisoka and not just tension, where you felt impaired in chapters fill that even though people complain, as this version were great and managed to conceive of something wonderful.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nCertainly I wished Nippon Animation would have continued with the creation of Hunter x Hunter, although it is thanks largely to MadHouse for the excellent work they did, they did too bright in the series, removing completely the tension and fear you felt when characters fought or were even on the verge of death.",

      "content": "I cannot recommend this anime for anything but comparison since the 2011 anime came out. While there may be a bias on my part having seen the 2011 adaptation first, if I had seen this version first I likely would have never stuck with the series to become a part of the fandom.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things this series has over the later adaptation: the first episode actually introduces a certain character, even though it never makes it to the famously large arc for that decision to pay off. 1999 also has the original take on Phase 2 of the Hunter's Exam, changed inthat I suppose the mangaka now realizes that foreigners know what sushi is, therefore a plot point is rendered a little ridiculous but the examiner's motivations and testing material remain in a consistent thread of logic.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nHowever, detracting from that is pretty much everything else. All of the filler added to the first arc or so of the series. The pacing slowed down to the speed of a snail. The tone is needlessly more somber. The art is, of course, rather old and doesn't feel nearly as sharp as the 2011 adaptation. Even the sound of the fighting feels like it has less impact.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nEvery day I pushed myself to watch this so I know I've seen all there was to Hunter x Hunter, each time it felt like a chore, which Hunter x Hunter should NEVER feel like. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple reasons to watch select episodes and clips. Some ongoing gags that are exclusive to this adaptation, seeing how your favorite scenes played out differently, those couple moments from the manga adapted here that the 2011 anime didn't touch. But I must say, going through all of this didn't feel worth it.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nI'm still planning to push ahead through all of the OVA episodes, which continues this series through what I believe to be the conclusion of the Greed Island arc in roughly another 30 episodes. Seeing as how the latest of those OVAs was back in 2004, that's at least a good few years for some techniques to improve, but I don't see the majority of my opinion of the series overall changing very much.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nI admit much of my criticism is cosmetic, but that's because the source material is wonderful no matter how you slice it. The way that it was animated here was just too boring.",

      "content": "I spent so many time to rewatch this series over and over again since I first saw it over a decade ago at TV show (I really glad that HxH was aired here back then), it has a high rewatch value for me.\r\n\r\nAt the first, I thought this series will be end just no more than 24 eps, but it wasn't turned out like that.\r\n\r\nEven this series has a remake version (HxH 2011) and has a continuation of the previous version, I'll just write these review for both of it.\r\n\r\nStory: HxH has a good story development, all arc are fabulous, and not a single episodeswasting. Every scene was memorable. My favorite arc is Greed Island.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nChara: I prefer old version HxH chara design, but a remake version was not so bad, there's a few of chara from a remake version that I liked too (but mostly I liked the old version). Time to time, MC has a great development, both in strenght and mental, either do the support chara.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nSound: almost all of HxH Old Version OST I loved to hear, especially the 2nd OP sung by Wino, I liked so much, a remake version OST was fine, but nothing specials I think. \\n\r\n\\n\r\nArt: in term of this, I prefer the remake version, the graphic quality are smoother, and for the background too. But at some point, as for me the old version left a deep impression.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I found a great time wathing this series eventhough I already rewatch it so many times. And my younger brother even more fanatic then me if it comes to HxH. LoL.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nOverall: This's a great Adventure genre anime, if you're seeking for it and has never watch this, I gonna say: you have to start watching HxH right now.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nI hope the next arc will coming soon enough unlike the previous one.",

DO I NEED TO SAY MORE I WAS LOOKING FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND THIS ANIME DELIVERED  IT 100%...go watch this beautiful story of friendship.its one of a kind masterpiece and don't stop here watch the ova s too...my friends enjoy!",

      "content": "First you must remember that this a fairly old anime, and at first the art work and sound might seem lacking, but don't let that put you off.  This is the anime that started it all... Flame of Recca, Naruto, Ninku and the rest, are in essence, imitations of HxH.\r\n\r\nThere's a riveting plot, a quest, if you will, that takes our group of protagonists all across the world in arbitrary adventures.  Although it starts out a little slow, it is an interesting enough story to hold your attention, besides you're rooting too hard for the underdog protagonist to stop yourself from finding outif he succeeds in his quest.  I mean come on, he fights with a fishing rod, how could that not be cool?  Speaking of which, there are some excellent fight sequences and some mind benders even!\\n\r\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are dated, but that hardly detracts from the enjoyment.  There are some excellent characters, creative and unique in their own ways, devious villains, and the usual comic relief.  The protagonist's naivity makes him awefully endearing and you're warped into his world view of &quot;all things are good&quot;... very reminiscent of Naruto, minus the repititive &quot;I will protect my friends&quot; dialogues.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this series and the subsequent sequels which were even better.  Besides, this is a landmark series that no fan of anime should miss.  I assure you, you will not be disappointed.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nTo those of you who have read my other reviews, I try not to get into a lenghty detailed philosophical understanding of the subplot in my reviews, all I have to say is I highly recommend this series and it's three OVA sequels.  \\n\r\n\\n\r\nI trust you will enjoy this as much as I have!",
